# Storyboard
### Backstory:

> A regular slime was just going about his normal routine wandering the caves, and decided one day to leave and go on an adventure.. It will not be an easy journey, but his will is strong. 

### Structure: 

 - Navigate through each floor of the dungeon to ESC to the outside world. 

 - Each floor has its own theme, with a Floor Master. 

 - Defeat the Floor Master to proceed to the next floor. Complete Floor Quests to possibly receieve Blessings.

	- If the floor quest is completed prior to the battle, player may receive a ***Blessing*** **(STAT BOOST)** before proceeding to the next floor. *(High Card, Low Card)* 
	- If the floor quest is ***not*** completed prior to the battle, player may receive a ***Curse*** **(STAT REDUCE)** before proceeding to the next floor. *(High Card, Low Card)* 

### Endings (All blessings, All curses, Mixed, None): 

 **All Blessings:** 
 : Player leaves the cave with all defeated Floor Masters. See a bright blue sky with a sun and golden wheat field (maybe mountains in the background). Set off on adventure together.<br>
	 	*(Receive all **Blessings** to get this ending)*

**All Curses:**
 : Player doesn’t exit the dungeon and becomes the new Dungeon Master. <br>
		 *(Receive all **Curses** to get this ending)*

**Mixed:** 
 : Player exits the Dungeon, but alone, or with the defeated Floor Masters.  Show scene of toasting to a new adventure. Have cups for each Floor Master, those who did not make it out, will still have their cups poured.<br>
	 	*(This is the neutral ending)*

**None:** 
 : Player changes mind and doesn’t leave the dungeon and goes back home(spawn) to live as simple slime. Have a bunch of slime buddies shown with our original slime.<br>
	 	*(Avoid all enemies to get this ending)*
