# Enemy A.I. Design  

> An overview of how enemies will behave both in battle, and on the map.  

### Enemy Logic in Battle:  
- Want enemy to notice how player is doing, to choose the best possible option.  
i.e. notice of player is near death, if they have status ailments, debuffs or buffs.  
- Enemy should notice when its health is low, etc.  
i.e. Enemy will take a look at its own health, and determine if they should heal, etc.
- Enemy should recognize if they have an advantage.  

### Enemy Logic in Map:  
- Enemy will move in a pre defined pattern.  
- If Enemy finds player, enemy charges towards them.   
- Different Enemies will have different perks.  

### Enemy Stats:  
- HP: Health Points  
- Skill: Impacts chance to land hit and critical hits  
- Luck: Used for chance to hit, dodge, and run away  
- Strength: Raw attack power  
- Speed: Used to determine who attacks first in battle  
- Defense: used to reduce attack damage taken  
- Mana: Like stamina. Used to reduce abuse of powerful attacks  

*The stronger the enemy, the higher the stats, or possible exagerated stats (i.e. High Skill for higher Crit Rate)*  

### Enemy Abilities:  
- Enemies will come with different abilities depending on the floor.  
- Enemies will seek to exploit their abilities if possible.  
*will be elaborated as game progresses*  

### Enemy Weapons:  
- Most Enemies will come equipped with weapon.  
- Weapon Implementations for Advantages or Disadvantages with Blessings and Curse system.  

*Same weapon types as player, but more fitting for enemies.*  
*Enemy Stats will depend on the enemy type and equipped weapon!*
