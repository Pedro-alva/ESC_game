## Project Summary

<Complete for May 2nd submission. See github.com repositories on how people shortblurb thre project e.g. REMOVE: It is a standalone section. It is written to give the reader a summary of your work. Be sure to specific, yet brief. Write this paragraph last (150-300 words)>


## Problem Statement 

< Complete for April 11 submission. Give a clear and complete statement of the problem.  What is the benchmark you are using.  Why?  Where does the data come from, what are its characteristics? Include informal success measures (e.g. accuracy on cross-validated data, without specifying ROC or precision/recall etc) that you planned to use. What do you hope to achieve?>

## Dataset 

<Complete for April 11. Description of the dataset (dimensions, names of variables with their description) If in doubt, use 3.1-3.3. [Datasheets For Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010) as a guideline.  If you are using benchmarks, describe the data in details. If you are collecting data, describe why, how, data format, volume, labeling, etc.>

<Complete for May 2nd submission. What Processing Tools have you used.  Why?  Add final images from jupyter notebook. Use questions from 3.4 of the [Datasheets For Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010) paper for a guide.>  


## Exploratory Data Analysis 

<Complete for April 11. What EDA graphs you are planning to use? Why? Add figures if any>

<Complete for May 2nd.  Describe the methods you explored (usually algorithms, or data wrangling approaches). Include images. Justify methods you are planning to use. > 

## Data Preprocessing 

<Complete for May 2nd. Have you considered Dimensionality Reduction or Scaling. If yes, include steps here.  What did you consider but *not* use? 

## Machine Learning Approaches

<Plan to have baseline evaluation by April 20. It is a useful checkpoint to establish a scale by which to measure your project's performance.>

<Complete May 2nd Describe the ML methods that you used and the reasons for their choice. What is the family of machine learning algorithms you are using and why?>

<Complete May 2nd Describe the methods/datasets (you can have unscaled, selected, scaled version, multiple data farmes) used for modeling. Justify the selection of machine learning tools you have used; How they informed the next steps? Make sure to include at least twp models: (1) baseline model, and (2) improvement model(s).  The baseline model  is typically the simplest model that's applicable to that data problem, something we have learned in the class. Improvement model(s) are available on Kaggle challenge site, and you can research github.com and papers with code for approaches.  

## Experiments

<Complete May 2. What did not work? What do you think why? What were approaches, tuning model parameters you have tried? What features worked well and what didn't? When describing methods that didn't work, make clear how they failed and any evaluation metrics you used to decide so. How was that a data-driven decision? Be consise, all details can be left in .ipynb>

<Complete May 2 This should only contain final version of the experiments. Describe how did you evaluate your solution What evaluation metrics did you use? Describe a baseline system. How much did your system outperform the baseline?  Were there other systems evaluated on the same dataset? How did your system do in comparison to theirs? Show graphs/tables with results Error analysis Suggestions for future improvement. Please use visualizations whenever possible.
 
 **Note** You will also submit a .ipynb with redundant information. Consider this markdown a README.md introduction file to the user for your project.
