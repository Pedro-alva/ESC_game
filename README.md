# Retrospective Sprint 1
# Ferengi Team

## What went well or maybe not?
> - Team - Creating an online white board allowing us to all contribute to it together proved to be really helpful in visualizing the game. 

> - Team - Something that didn't so well was our starting our Unity project folder late into the sprint. 

> - Team - The creation of indiviual feature branches will come in handy once we get better at pushing through them. 

> - Team - Having a Google doc when we're actively brain storming has proved to be a success as everyone is allowed to edit the doc and place their own input. 

> - Team - What has gone really well is our team bonding. Currently there are no issues within the indiviaul team members. 

> - Angel C   - As a team, we managed to collaborate on planning out a game. However, it proved difficult, as we are still getting used to new technologies. I personally could do a better job at making sure the team is on the same page when applying ideas and design into my tasks. I also failed to recognize how important researching technologies can be, and instead jumped into immidietly wanting to get the tasks done. 

> - Whitney P - Creating the Unity Project file and linking it to the Project folder went well. Was able to add folders as well to the file for us to use for for our assets. I waited a bit too long to push the project to the repo and it held up our production time.

> - Danny D   -  I got ahead of myself when it came to the save/load function as I needed more of the game. 

> - Pedro A   - The creation of the indiviaul branches and implementing got done. Gitkraken is still rough looking but we're doing better at actually using our branches. I honestly could've done a lot more work and finished the blocking for the tutorial floor but due to having work from other classes spill over I wasn't able to.   

> - Carlie K  - Was able to work well to plan game with group and most ideas Were agreed unanimously. However it is occasionally difficult to find a time to meet continent for everyone. 

## What might be Impeding us from Perfoming better? 

> - One of the things we can improve on is our meeting schedule. Currently, our meetings get planned the day of or, at the earliest, the day before. If we created a set schedule of meeting times, it would help everyone plan out their day better.

> - As a team we can also do better in communicating when a push is being done and documenting what has been added or changed in that push. 

## What can I do to Improve? 
> - Angel C - Make sure I get an opinion from everyone, and plan things out, before
I make design documents or complete tasks. I can also educate myself 
in the technologies that are to be used better, instead of jumping
straight into the action

> - Whitney P - Contact members of the team directly to complete the parts of the project I am working on so I don't wait too long to push to the repo

> - Danny D - I need to get in the habit of adding more and better comments to my code. And I will do that by commenting on my code before I push by going to unity to double check that I have comments

> - Pedro A - I need to get better in communicating how long something might take me. In this first sprint I fell behind and this can't happen in the next two sprints. I also need to get better at pushing my unique changes to the project file to my branch and not the master brach on GitKraken. 

> - Carlie K - I am still having issues with gitkraken and making my comments

> *Comments: Applied first iteration of combat system. At the moment, the only option is to attack. Note that Turn-based combat task, and enemy   
attack and retaliate task are dependent on each other, so they have a similar commit. I implemented both player and enemy attack in one similar comit.  
Additionally, I added the title screen music and sfx which can be found in the Soundtrack folder of the respective branch, and merged into Master via Pull Request. Note  
that I was not able to implement the battle music as mentioned in my previous sprint, as we later discovered it would be most fitting to implement  
title screen music and sfx due to the progress we have so far. The contribution*

# Retrospective Sprint 2
# Ferengi Team

## What went well or maybe not?
> - Team - Creating branches and using them proved better this time around. We submitted to our own branches. 

> - Team - Something that didn't go well is the file organization on our Unity project. 

> - Team - As a team we found more resoueces to get better at working with Unity. 

> - Team - Through out the sprint we continued to work well together as in team. We had a couple of hiccups that got impeded us from performing better but we got through it. 

> - Angel C   - I managed to get a quick grasp on how Unity engine works, in order to implement what I needed to. However, because I am still relatively new to the technology, the implementation of some features took me much longer than I anticipated. Also, while I am glad I got to compose video game music, but the shorter time frame made me realize compositon takes time.  

> - Whitney P - I was able to reorganize the project files, but I could have communicated better where to place things so there would be less confusion.

> - Denny D   -  I followed a fellow classmates advice and used player prefs for the save function 

> - Pedro A   - The creation of the indiviaul branches and implementing got done. Gitkraken is still rough looking but we're doing better at actually using our branches. I honestly could've done a lot more work and finished the blocking for the tutorial floor but due to having work from other classes spill over I wasn't able to. 

> - Carlie K  - Had hardware issues resolved. I learned more about creating visual novels and got comfortable using gitkraken. 

## What might be Impeding us from Perfoming better? 

> - Something that is impeding us from performing better is the unorganization we currently have going on in the unity project file. The unorganization has allowed for work to spread in the wrong areas. 

## What can I do to Improve? 
> - Angel C - I can benefit from getting more experience with Unity outside of sprints. I can demonstrate my improvements on this by  
being able to finish Unity-related tasks quicker, and to hopefully overcome any blocks at a quicker pace. Additionally, I can be much  
clearer on my commits, as the comments I put can be ambiguous in terms of what Jira tasks they belong to.  

> - Whitney P - Be more specific with file and folder instructions/layouts. I can also work on learning more about Ink coding.

> - Denny D - I need to get in the habit of commiting my work promptly when I finish a task.

> - Pedro A - I need to get better at asking for help when I need it instead of spending so much time trying to teach my self a technique that others already could possibly know. 

> - Carlie K - I feel behind this sprint and nearly lost all of my work. Luckily I was able to resolve the issue so that I can start on the next sprint quickly. I should delegate more of my time to working on the visual novel as well as creating the different endings for the game.

> *Comments: All tasks except for "Battle Equip Item UI" and "Map & Battle Scene transition" have been completed. I am currently working
on those two tasks. The reason for this lack of progress is due to issues with Unity and Merging. Due to the way Unity works, when Merging
Master into my feature branches, something ended up corrupted. Upon further research, it seems that the gitignore file has not been negating
the needless binary and temporary files that Unity creates. I will continue to work on these.*

* For Sprint #4, I plan on finishing item layouts, and the map and battle transitions if they are still not finished. Also, I plan on contributing to dungeun music, mixing, 
and programming. I also plan on implementing Item stat benefits, which are described in the Turn-based combat documentation. I also plan on working in creating different types
of enemies to improve the dynamics of the game, and running some tests to ensure that the enemies nor the player are too overpowered.*

> - Team - Through out the sprint we continued to work well together as in team. We had a couple of hiccups that got impeded us from performing better but we got through it. 

> - Angel C   - I managed to apply my new Unity Game Engine related skills, and was able to provide quicker results. However, using Unity Version Control has been tricky due to the nature of the Software. Struggled with merge conflicts, and applying more technical programming scripts.  

> - Whitney P - I was able to reorganize the project files, but I could have communicated better where to place things so there would be less confusion.

> - Denny D   -  I completed two of my tasks

> - Pedro A   - The creation of the indiviaul branches and implementing got done. Gitkraken is still rough looking but we're doing better at actually using our branches.

## What can I do to Improve? 
> - Angel C - Aside from further improving my skills with Unity Engine itself, I can learn more about Unity Merging and Git. This improvement will be showcased by  
having more succesful merges, and not having to spend a significant amount of time reading illegible merge conflicts, and solving them as well.  

> - Whitney P - Be more specific with file and folder instructions/layouts. I can also work on learning more about Ink coding.

> - Denny D - Be more specifics with my tasks and break them down into parts

> - Pedro A - I need to get better at asking for help when I need it instead of spending so much time trying to teach my self a technique that others already could possibly know.
